It is a truth universally acknowledged,1 that a single man in
possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man
may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so
well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he
is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of
their daughters.
“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have
you heard that Netherfield Park2 is let at last?”
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here,
and she told me all about it.”
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
“Do not you want to know who has taken it?” cried his
wife impatiently.
“You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”
This was invitation enough.
“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that
Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from
the north of England; that he came down3 on Monday in a
chaise and four4 to see the place, and was so much delighted
with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he
is to take possession before Michaelmas,5 and some of his
servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.”
“What is his name?”
“Bingley.”
